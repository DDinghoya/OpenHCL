Each screen has two .map files: one for the background (###a.map) and one for the foreground (###.map).

The ID number for each screen is hardcoded. See 'stagedata.h'.

Every screen has a 3 tile border surrounding it. So while the visible area is 16x12 tiles, the actual map data is 22x18 tiles. See 'map sample.png' for an example.

018.map is not a map file, it is instead a backup save file.

=== Tile Data ===
Begins at 0018
Size = [Map width] * [Map height] * 2 (always 792)
Each tile is stored in 2 bytes, however in Hydra Castle Labyrinth the second byte is not needed.

Certain foreground tiles are used for collision.
